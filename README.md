# 261433 Network Programming

## Course Overview

This course introduces the concepts of network programming and also its practical detail to students. Network programming integrates the concept of software development and data communication where the main focus is how to send data between two point effienciently and securely. The current course focuses on client/server model, a de-facto model on network programming, with TCP/IP stacks. The second part of the course will focus on mobile client, both implemented with web technology and native mobile technology. The course consists on lecturers and a series of hand-on programming homework

## Course Learning Objectives
1. Explain the concepts in network programming
2. Develop server application
3. Develop client application

## Prerequisites
1. C# and .Net Core Programming Skill (please install .Net Core 2.0 or later with Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio 2017)
2. Github account
3. Basic knowledge on TCP/IP operation

# Recommended Reading
1. Bandwidth vs. Latecny vs. Throughput [1](https://www.ecessa.com/blog/what-are-bandwidth-latency-and-throughput-and-what-is-right-for-your-business/), [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWxGtl5J7WM),  

# Grading Rubrics
## Professional Conduct
We expect our students to conduct themselves professionally, at least, for the following areas:
- Taking personal responsibility for class prerequisites and coming to class prepared
- Taking personal responsibility for scheduling and managing the homework
- Treating others in a respectful manner
- Plagiarism is not acceptable in any cases
- Accepting things you cannot change, working respectfully within the system to change things you can, and choosing your battles wisely

## Attendance including Active & Enthusiastic Participation
- Prepares for class by watching and studying the textbooks and readings.
- Answers in-class questions frequently
- Actively participates and frequently takes a leadership role in break outs

## Making Up Missed Classes
- Whether excused or unexcused absence, missed classes must be made up in order to earn a grade of B or higher for the semester
- To make up a class, students study the slide, work any in-class exercises on their own, write up an executive summary, and submit the executive summary to the instructor using a CMU Elearning or email (pruet@eng.cmu.ac.th) before the next class meeting start time
- Executive Summary should be a PDF file, 1 to 1.5 pages in length, professionally formatted,12 point font, 1 inch margins.

## Assignments
- 8 Assignments, count as 20% toward final score
- 7 of 8 will count
  - 1 lowest will be dropped
  - However, to be dropped, the assignment must be turned in with a reasonable attempt
- Each assignment is graded in whole numbers between 0 and 10 points
  - Subjective = 2 of 10 points
    - Most students will score a 1 on subjective on most assignments
    - A score of 2 on subjective indicates exceptional performance and typically only 10% of students in a section will make this
  - Objective = 8 of 10 points
- Late Submissions
  - Assignments 1 through 7
    - When grading, a zero will be put in as a "placeholder"  for missing submissions and changed when they are submitted
    - 1 of 10 points penalty for 1 second late
    - Additional 1 point penalty for each additional 24 hours late
    - After 10 days late, the assignment will be worth zero points
  - Assignment 8
    - Due to end of semester time constraints, late submissions for assignment 8 will have the following late penalties
    - 5 of 10 points for 1 second lateZero for the assignment if 24 hours late
    
## Exams
- Midterm exam
  - Cover the content of week 1 - 7
  - Count 40% toward final score
- Final exam
